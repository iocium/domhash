/**
 * Represents the options available for configuring a DOM hashing operation. 
 * The `DomHashOptions` interface allows users to customize the behavior of 
 * the hashing process, including the choice of algorithm, attributes to 
 * include, and various flags that influence how the DOM is processed.
 *
 * @interface DomHashOptions
 * @property {'sha256' | 'murmur3' | 'blake3' | 'simhash' | 'minhash'} [algorithm] - 
 *          An optional string specifying the hashing algorithm to be used. 
 *          Supported algorithms include:
 *          - `'sha256'`: A widely-used cryptographic hash function.
 *          - `'murmur3'`: A non-cryptographic hash function known for its speed.
 *          - `'blake3'`: A fast cryptographic hash function designed for performance.
 *          - `'simhash'`: An algorithm for similarity hashing used in machine learning.
 *          - `'minhash'`: An algorithm used for estimating the similarity between datasets.
 * @property {string[]} [includeAttributes] - An optional array of strings 
 *                                             specifying which attributes should 
 *                                             be included in the hash calculation. 
 *                                             This allows for fine-tuning of the 
 *                                             hashed output based on specific 
 *                                             attributes of interest.
 * @property {boolean} [includeDataAndAriaAttributes] - An optional boolean flag 
 *                                                    indicating whether to include 
 *                                                    data-* and ARIA attributes in 
 *                                                    the hashing process. If set to 
 *                                                    true, these attributes will be 
 *                                                    considered in the hash.
 * @property {boolean} [shapeVector] - An optional boolean flag that determines 
 *                                      whether to generate a shape vector for 
 *                                      the DOM structure. When true, the shape 
 *                                      of the DOM will be represented as a 
 *                                      vector, which may help in analyzing the 
 *                                      layout or arrangement of elements.
 * @property {boolean} [layoutAware] - An optional boolean flag indicating if 
 *                                      the hashing operation should consider 
 *                                      layout information. If true, the hash 
 *                                      will reflect changes in layout, which 
 *                                      can be significant for responsive designs.
 * @property {boolean} [resilience] - An optional boolean flag that indicates 
 *                                     whether to evaluate and include resilience 
 *                                     metrics in the hash result. Setting this 
 *                                     to true will incorporate aspects of 
 *                                     structural integrity into the hashing 
 *                                     process.
 * @property {string} [corsProxy] - An optional string specifying a CORS proxy 
 *                                   URL to be used when fetching external resources 
 *                                   (e.g., stylesheets, scripts) during the hashing 
 *                                   process. This is useful for handling cross-origin 
 *                                   requests and ensuring that all necessary resources 
 *                                   are accessible.

 * @property {string[]} attributes - An array of strings representing the 
 *                                   attributes of the node. Each string should 
 *                                   be formatted as "key=value" to define
